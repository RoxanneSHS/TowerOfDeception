@0    = ~Yes! Yes, you've made it! I felt it when the Power of the Astral Shard vanished, and now I can see it lying destroyed before me. I am able to teleport once again! I will be able to get out of this place for good...~
@1    = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, I was beginning to think I'd be stuck here forever. But because of you, I am free, once again, as is everyone here. My energies are still drained, but there is enough power inside me to teleport you outside of the tower.~
@2    = ~I hope we'll meet again sometime. Take care of yourself.~
