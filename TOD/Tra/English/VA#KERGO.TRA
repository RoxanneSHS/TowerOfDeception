@1    = ~Bah, enough talking, time for some sailing. I hope you're ready, the ship awaits. Good luck to us all...~
@2    = ~Well, we have arrived at last. This place looks damned creepy, but I've been paid to get you here and back, so I'll wait here for your return, <CHARNAME>. Take care, only the gods know what's inside...~
@3    = ~At last, you're back. Can we go home now? I don't feel very comfortable here.~
@4    = ~Yes, captain. It is finished. Let us sail back to Athkatla.~
@5    = ~That's music to my ears. Very well then, we'll take our leave right now. I'll drop you right in front of Tian. He's expecting us, I'm sure.~
@6    = ~I tell you truly, I don't like it here...~
