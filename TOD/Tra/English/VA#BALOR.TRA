@1    = ~I could ask you the same question...~
@2    = ~You want to know... as a last wish before you die? I will not grant this wish, *corpses*! No doubt you come for some sort of revenge... which shall go unrealized. Ha-ha-ha!!~ [va#bal02]
@3    = ~Revenge!? What revenge are you talking about? We heard some rumors about an abandoned tower near the Coast and decided to investigate. We did not expect to find a creature like you here.~
@4    = ~Enough! You cannot fool me! I am done talking with you. Now you'll die!!~ [va#bal03]
