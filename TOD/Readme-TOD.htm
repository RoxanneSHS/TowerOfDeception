  <p><strong>Version v5.0.1</strong></p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is an adaptation of the Tower of Deception <acronym title="Dungeons And Dragons">D&amp;D</acronym>
     adventure originally created by Monte Cook for the <strong><a href="http://www.wizards.com/">D&amp;D website</a></strong>.
     I liked this adventure, so I thought it could be a good idea to transform it into BG2:ToB engine.
     I couldn't keep all aspects of the original adventure due to <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> engine limits
     (e.g. non-existing creatures etc.), so I made my own little modified version.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is designed to work with <strong>Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition or EET</strong> or <strong>Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal</strong> (with the latest patch - <strong>v26498</strong> installed).</p>
  <p>Install <strong>Tower Of Deception (TOD) </strong>mod after <strong>Divine Remix </strong>mod, as it alters spells in Lizard Man Shaman's spellbook.</p>
  <p>There are no known incompatibilities.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>When Ustrain Yg'nuv, an evil githyanki wizard, built his tower on a rocky island amid the misty 
   moors of Halron Bay, he had no idea that sailors would mistake the light of his magical Astral 
   Shard at the top of his tower for the beacon of a lighthouse. The light brought many sailors to
   an untimely doom. But Ustran did not care. He laughed at their plight and continued his nefarious
   work: using the power of the Astral Shard to kidnap creatures in the midst of teleporting and 
   divert them to his lair. One day, however, his own people appeared to drag the githyanki wizard 
   back to his native Astral Plane. He's not been seen since.</p>
<p>But his tower remains. Not only does it continue to trick sailors on foggy nights (though most 
   now have been warned by the legends of the "haunted lighthouse"), but the magic of the Astral 
   Shard continues Ustrain's evil abduction scheme. Originally, Ustrain enslaved or robbed the 
   victims the Shard delivered to him. With the githyanki gone, now they remain trapped within the
   evil tower until they devise an escape or die.</p>
<p>You and your group are hired by a mage called Tian to go visit the tower and find something 
	valuable for him, for a reasonable price, of course. Tian is located in The Crooked Crane Inn
	at the City Gates. Go there, speak with him and adventure begins...</p>
<p>Recommended average party level is between <strong>10 - 13.</strong> Also you should have some stronger weapons equipped, <strong>Lilarcor +3</strong> is a good example. I don't recommend to play it on lower levels, as there are some monsters that can't be hit without weapons of at least +2 enchantment...</p>

  <p><strong>Version v3.3</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Battle with Ustrain has been changed. Originally it has two versions - with or without IA installed. But I have received many reactions from players that the battle is either too hard with IA, or too easy without it. Also they wanted a version independent from IA, so Razfallow remade Encounter with Ustrain, using his own scripts. This version is more like an addition to the previous one than a replacement. For those who want to play without IA installed, but with harder Ustrain. </li>
